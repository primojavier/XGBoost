# Effective XGBoost by Matt Harrison - My Personal Take

This repository contains my personal notes, examples, and code implementations based on the book "Effective XGBoost" by Matt Harrison. The purpose of this repo is to document my journey as I peer thru the mind of a master displaying his craft so I could glean some insights myself into building models that I could use for my projects.
